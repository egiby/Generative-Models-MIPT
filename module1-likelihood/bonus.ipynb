    "Here are some tips that you may find useful for designing and training these models:\n",
    "* You will need a 4-way softmax for every prediction, as opposed to a 256-way softmax in the PixelCNN paper, since the dataset is quantized to two bits per color channel\n",
    "* You can set number of filters for each convolutions to 120. You can use the ReLU nonlinearity throughout.\n",
    "* Use a stack of 8 residual block architecture from [Figure 5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759) but with 7 x 7 masked convolutions in the middle instead of 3 x 3 masked convolutions\n",
    "* Consider using [layer normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) to improve performance. However, be careful to maintain the autoregressive property. Do not try to use batch normalization, it's not working with autoregressive models at all\n",
    "* With a learning rate of $10^{-3}$ and a batch size of 128, it should take a few minutes to run on the shapes dataset, and about 50-60 minutes on MNIST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Report training curves, final test loss, and samples\n",
    "\n",
    "### PixelCNN variations\n",
    "\n",
    "- (10 points) Implement a [Gated PixelCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05328) to fix the blind-spot issue. Train it on binary MNIST, and report training curves, final test loss, and samples.\n",
    "- (10 points) Train a [Grayscale PixelCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08185) on Colored MNIST. You do not need to use their architecture - stacking standard masked convolutions or residual blocks is fine. First, generate a binary image, and then the 2-bit color image."
